  <h2 id="installation">Week 0</h2>

  <p>Completed project proposal outline, set up Git repository repo for weekly progress blog, and solidified project idea with group and professor. </p>

  <h2 id="features">Week 1</h2>

  <p>
    Started formatting and uploading information to the website and began outlining the project proposal.
  </p>


<h2 id="based-on">Week 2</h2>

<p>We worked on setting up a rough timeline, and started our background research and competitor research to inform our project motivation. A large part of our research was informing ourselves of what a typical public high school might offer and what initiatives are available to provide computer science education. We also started drafting our project proposal and researching lesson plans with approval of more project choices with the professor.
</p>

<h2 id="installation-jekyll-remote-theme-method">Vision</h2>

<p>As of now, the program can consist of ten 60 minute sessions that can be implemented in a format of an afterschool program. Each session will delve into a different topic of technology. Below are some ideas for the sessions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to Leetcode/Basics of Coding</li>
  <li>How to Prepare for Internships &amp; Technical Interviews</li>
  <li>Research in Computer Science</li>
  <li>Series of Sessions that Discuss the Intersection of CS and other fields (English, Music, etc)</li>
  <li>Guide to Hackathons (what are they? is it worth it?)</li>
  
</ul>
