  <h2 id="installation">Description</h2>

  <p>Developing a curriculum for 10 independent sessions that would introduce New York City Public High School Students (11th to 12th graders specifically) to the bigger field of technology. Through these sessions, the students will be able to develop a better understanding of how technology is intertwined with their various interests. It will also provide students with a solid foundation for a Computer Science major at a higher educational institution with hopes of bridging the achievement gap.</p>

<h2 id="features">Background</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=129882">Increasing accessibility to computer science education across the U.S. (NSF):</a> The 2013 press release from the National Science Foundation, speaks of their (now inactive) CS10K initiative. They summarize that there is a need for qualified CS educators, CS education isn't mandatory in many places, there needs to be an early start in CS education. They  also give background and verbal support to programs: FRABJOUS, Mobile CSP, Teach for America, Project Lead the Way, The Games Network, and STARS Computing Corps.

    <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/stories/students-need-more-access-to-computer-science-education">Students Need More Access to Computer Science Education (Teach For America):</a> This 2020 article summarizes useful statistics of the STEM education gap and argues that K-12 education is key to tackle this inequity. Teach For America announces their partnership with Cognizant U.S. Foundation on ‚Äúexpanding computer science pathways in low-income schools nationwide‚Äù, with a three-pronged strategy of increasing access to high-quality CS education, advancing the CS conversation, and fostering learning and drive innovation.

    <a href="https://harvardpolitics.com/computer-science-accessibility/">The Case for Computer Science Accessibility (Harvard Political Review):</a> This December 2022 article speaks of the success of computer science initiatives in boosting STEM education interest and retention, how it benefits students‚Äô performances in other subjects, and how it fosters skills useful for all careers in a technology-oriented world. Especially beneficial is ‚Äúfree, high-quality instructional material‚Äù that makes CS classes as long as the school has computer access.

This program aims to create ‚Äúthe necessary infrastructure to provide computer science experiences to all New York City public-school students‚Äù. This initiative was announced in 2015 by NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. This article can be helpful with our overall understanding of the plans to implement more CS Education on a public school level in order to differentiate our own curriculum.

    <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED591502">Computer Science in New York City: An Early Look at Teacher Training Opportunities and the Landscape of CS Implementation in Schools. Technical Appendices:</a> This is another article that covers CS4All which also ‚Äúaims to provide professional development (PD) in CS for nearly 5,000 teachers, specifically targeting those with little or no computer science background. The initiative is focused in part on increasing access to CS education among students from historically underrepresented groups, including girls, Black and Latino students, English Learners, and special education students‚Äù. This specific report describes ‚Äúfindings from the first year of the evaluation‚Äù and includes the goals and strategies of the program, an early implementation of the program and how teachers are responding to the professional development.

A secondary purpose is to determine the current attitudes held by graduates and faculty supervisors toward the cooperative method in order to assess the relative perceived value of cooperative programs.‚Äù This can be helpful in our overall report when it comes to background information regarding the importance of these programs.

<h2 id="based-on">Motivation</h2>

<p>Our main motivations for this project stem from our own experience of trying to adjust to the Computer Science curriculum at Columbia as first year students. All three of us were coming to college from New York City Public High Schools with little to no experience in the tech world. Despite starting off with introductory courses in the CS department just as all prospective CS majors are required to do, we still felt a huge learning curve and felt as though we were at a disadvantage. There were students in our Intro CS classes that had years of experience under their belt while we were just starting out. We decided we wanted to create a program that can be implemented in high schools in order to help bridge this gap. </p>

<h2 id="installation-jekyll-remote-theme-method">Vision</h2>

<p>As of now, the program can consist of ten 60 minute sessions that can be implemented in a format of an afterschool program. Each session will delve into a different topic of technology. Below are some ideas for the sessions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to Leetcode/Basics of Coding</li>
  <li>How to Prepare for Internships &amp; Technical Interviews</li>
  <li>Research in Computer Science</li>
  <li>Series of Sessions that Discuss the Intersection of CS and other fields (English, Music, etc)</li>
  <li>Guide to Hackathons (what are they? is it worth it?)</li>
  
</ul>
