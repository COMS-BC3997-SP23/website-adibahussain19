  <h2 id="installation">Week 0</h2>

  <p>Completed project proposal outline, set up Git repository repo for weekly progress blog, and solidified project idea with group and professor. </p>

  <h2 id="features">Week 1</h2>

  <p>
    Started formatting and uploading information to the website and began outlining the project proposal.
  </p>


<h2 id="based-on">Week 2</h2>

<p>We worked on setting up a rough timeline, and started our background research and competitor research to inform our project motivation. A large part of our research was informing ourselves of what a typical public high school might offer and what initiatives are available to provide computer science education. We also started drafting our project proposal and researching lesson plans with approval of more project choices with the professor.</p>


<h2 id="license">Week 3</h2>

<p>The project proposal was completed this week, including a description, background, competitor research, motivation, course overview/vision and minimum/target/reach goals. We also added a draft of our timeline and adapted a sample outline for our lesson plans from CS For All. The website to track progress was updated with weekly entries and the final project proposal was published to the website as well. We also had a meeting with the Access Barnard department of Barnard College, since they have a partnership with public NYC high schools to promote Barnard, Opportunity Programs, and the Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP). Since this state-wide program supports students that are interested in STEM fields at Barnard, Raul Cervantes of Access Barnard was interested in the possibility of us teaching a computer science course to high school students. We will continue to explore this possibility with him, since it could be an opportunity for us to try out a lesson plan with our expected demographic.</p>
