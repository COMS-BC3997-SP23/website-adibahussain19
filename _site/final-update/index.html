  <h2 id="features">A message from the founders</h2>

  <p>
    When we first began this project, we aimed to create a program that was accessible and bridged the gap between high school knowledge of computer science and a baseline understanding of the CS field that will prepare NYCDOE students for a college education in computer science. As graduates of New York City high schools, our mission is deeply tied to our beginnings as computer science students with no prior knowledge of CS. Just like finding support in each other has helped us navigate STEM’s “leaky” pipeline, we want to expose and prepare students like us for this field that has done so much for us, our educations, and our careers. As a result, CS Bridge’s main values are accessibility, collaboration, and community.
  </p>


<h2 id="based-on">Project Update:</h2>
<p>As of May 2023, CS Bridge has reached a point in its development where the first half of the curriculum lesson plans are complete, we have the introductory and closing student diagnostic quizzes, an initial project proposal, the slides for the first day, this abstract, and a final project report. Our progress has been fully documented in the weekly blog posts on our website, and will hopefully serve as a guide for how this project has evolved. We hope that the progress made on CS Bridge will eventually be continued on the same trajectory if this project is picked up by a team with similar values and connections to this project as we have.
</p>

<h2 id="license">Note to Contributors and Educators</h2>

<p>For the creation of the curriculum and the diagnostics, we researched the CS For All lesson plans and we consulted Bobby Koeth III of the Columbia University Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) as well as Alex Pittman at the Barnard College Center of Engaged Pedagogy (CEP). The main goal we decided on with these diagnostic tools and for the teaching style, in general, is to incentivize students to take responsibility for their own learning. Their responses on the diagnostics will ideally be shared with them at the end of the program to show them their growth, as well as serve as an attendance/exit slip for educator and program needs. Outside of the diagnostics, educators should not be surprised if students attend classes sporadically, especially since most classes are stand-alone and don’t require prior knowledge. They should instead emphasize the applicable career knowledge and incentivize students with snacks to create a good environment students are excited to be. 
</p>
<p>During our research, we found great resources for NYCDOE educators that want to learn how to become better educators in computer science. The nonprofit organization <a href="https://mouse.org/educators">Mouse</a>  provides free customized computer science professional development that is New York State CTLE-approved. Available K-12 topics include the Title IV-funded Design League, DIIT Remote Learning, and Code.org CS Fundamentals, Discoveries &amp; Principles. The <a href="(https://cep.barnard.edu/active-learning-guide">Barnard College CEP</a> also provides more resources available for educators for overall teaching and active learning skills, especially since CS Bridge values participatory and involved environments and content. Since this program is voluntary, active learning is key to promoting self-guided knowledge with activities and discussions. We encourage educators to run CS Bridge to not just present knowledge but instead help students learn on their own. Project-based learning and written goals for each session help students know what they want to achieve and use the resources available to them to get there. Other online interactive tools we recommend are Poll Everywhere and Kahoot, since they are interactive and encourage students to use their personal devices to their advantage.
